# Python for research!
Recently, I have gone through __HarvardX: PH526x__ program launched by __Harvard University__. However, I have find very interesting case studies. I have resolved all of them. Here, I am going to share.

What you'll learn...
---
- Python 3 core concepts.
- Python tools (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit learn, and SciPy modules) for research applications.
- How to apply Python research tools in any real time application.

__Research__
- HarvardX pursues the science of learning. When you participate in this course, you will also participate in research about learning. Read our [research statement](http://harvardx.harvard.edu/research-statement) to learn more.
